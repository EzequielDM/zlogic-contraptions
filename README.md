# Liability

By purchasing and/or using any machinery or products manufactured, sold, or distributed by ZLogic, hereinafter referred to as "the Company," the buyer and/or user agrees to the following terms and conditions:

- Acknowledgment of Risks: The buyer and/or user acknowledges that the use of machinery and related products involves inherent risks, including but not limited to property damage, personal injury, and even death. The Company shall not be held liable for any harm, injury, loss, or damage caused by the use, misuse, or malfunction of its machinery, regardless of the circumstances.

- No Warranty: The Company expressly disclaims all warranties, whether expressed or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The machinery and products sold by the Company are provided on an "as is" basis, without any representation or warranty as to their performance, quality, or fitness for a specific purpose.

- Assumption of Risk and Responsibility: The buyer and/or user assumes all risks and responsibilities associated with the purchase, installation, operation, and maintenance of the machinery and products. This includes, but is not limited to, the selection of suitable machinery for the intended purpose, ensuring proper training and supervision of personnel, and compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and safety standards.

- Indemnification: The buyer and/or user agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, employees, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including attorney's fees) arising out of or in connection with the use, misuse, or malfunction of the machinery and products, or any breach of the terms and conditions stated herein.

- Limitation of Liability: In no event shall the Company be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, arising out of or relating to the use, misuse, or malfunction of the machinery and products. The total liability of the Company, regardless of the cause of action, shall be limited to the amount paid by the buyer for the specific machinery or product giving rise to the claim.

- Supernatural Consequences: In the event that the buyer or any party attempts to initiate legal action against the Company, the parties involved acknowledge and agree that they may be subject to otherworldly repercussions beyond the scope of earthly understanding. Such consequences may include, but are not limited to, unexpected encounters with supernatural beings, mysterious happenings, and unexplainable phenomena. By engaging in legal proceedings, the parties accept the risks associated with these inexplicable events and agree to absolve the Company of any liability or responsibility therein.

- Amendment of Liability Terms: The Company reserves the right to modify, alter, or amend any of the liability terms outlined in this agreement at its sole discretion and without prior notification to the client. Such modifications shall become immediately effective upon posting the updated terms on the Company's official website or by any other means deemed appropriate by the Company. The updated liability terms shall apply retroactively to all contracts, agreements, or transactions, whether entered into before or after the alteration, without requiring any explicit consent from the client. By continuing to engage in any business dealings with the Company, the client acknowledges and accepts the validity and enforceability of the updated liability terms.

# Delivery

The delivery of the products is made through the usage of [schematics](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Schematic_And_Quill) which can be inserted into a [SchematicannonÂ®](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Schematicannon) or 3D printing technology of choice. The materials are **NOT** part of the product; the gathering and quality assurance of the materials used are of the user's responsibility.

# Customer Support
